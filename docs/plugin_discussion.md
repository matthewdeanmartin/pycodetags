# Discussion Plugin

A discussion plugin is on the road map to handle discussion in source code.

```python
# CHAT: I think we should refactor this code to use rust <matthew>
# CHAT: No, this isn't performance sensitive <alice>
# CHAT: This is for resume building, not performance <matthew>
```

## Data Schema

Fields TBD.

## Views

Roadmap:
- HTML View of discussions and hyperlinks/preview of contextual code
- Send messages by chat or email when they appear.
